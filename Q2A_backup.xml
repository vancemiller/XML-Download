<questions><question><title>points off for complicated Kara program?</title><content><![CDATA[<p>
	Tim Lin Wu asks</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		I have completed the Checkerboard Assignment. However, my solution is quite more complex than the solutions given. The only upside to my solution is that even if the width is an even number, it doesn't crash, it just makes straight columns of clovers. I was wondering if I would get points off for the more roundabout/complex solution. Is the assignment asking for a more simple solution than the solutions given by the program?</p>

<p><strong>B: D is a knave, if and only if C is a knight.</strong></p>
<p>From this, I took that:</p>

<p>With these two biconditionals, my truth table does not show a full row of truth anywhere.</p>

We are going to look at the set of all fractional parts, $ {F_{\alpha}=\{[na]\mid\forall n\in I\!\!N\}}$.  Recall that a number $ \alpha$ is irrational iff there do not exist integers $ p,q$ satisfying $ {\alpha=p/q}$.  Show the following:

	<li>For any irrational number $ \alpha$, the elements we put into set $ {F_{\alpha}}$ are distinct. That is, for all positive integers $ m,n\in I\!\!N$, we have $ {[m\alpha]=[n\alpha]}$ iff $ m=n$.</li>

<p>Each card has four features.  According to the rules, there are three choices for each feature.</p>
<p><strong>(A) Color:</strong> Each card is <em>red</em>, <em>green</em>, or <em>purple</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(B) Symbol:</strong> Each card contains <em>ovals</em>, <em>squiggles</em>, or <em>diamonds</em>.</p>
<p><strong>(C) Number:</strong> Each card has <em>one</em>, <em>two</em>, or <em>three</em> symbols.</p>
<p><strong>(D) Shading:</strong> Each card is <em>solid</em>, <em>open</em>, or <em>striped</em>.</p>

<p>1. How many cards are in a SET deck?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A &#039;Set&#039; consists of three cards in which each feature is EITHER the same on each card OR is different on each card. (Thus, "If two are... and one is not, then it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> a &#039;Set&#039;.")  Visit <a href="http://magliery.com/Set/SetRules.html" target="_blank">the set rules </a>to see examples of both sets and non-sets.</p>
<p>2. If you choose two cards, how many cards from the SET deck will complete a Set?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What is the maximum number of cards you can lay out without having a Set among them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Can you create a 3×3 square of set cards in which every row, column, and diagonal is a set?  In how many different ways?</p>

Good luck to anyone who attempts to solve it.</p>
<p>1. Each card in the standard deck of fifty-two cards consists of one of four suits and thirteen values. In the game of Badugi, the goal is to get four cards that have different suits and different values. Such a hand is called a Badugi. For example, {3 of hearts, 7 of diamonds, jack of clubs, queen of spades} is a Badugi, but {four of spades, four of diamonds, 9 of clubs, 10 of hearts} and {2 of spades, 5 of diamonds, 6 of clubs, king of clubs} are not.</p>
<p>What is the probability that you are dealt a four-card hand that contains three cards of different suits and different values, but is not a Badugi? (In other words, you are one card away from a Badugi.)</p>
<p>HINT: The answer is 57.05% but can you explain how to get it.</p>
<p>You could ignore the suits for an easier version to start with.</p>]]></content><category>assn3 (10,12 Sep)</category></question><question><title>Can you convert quantified expressions to English statements and vice versa?</title><content><![CDATA[<p>Let $ D$ be the set of all dorms on campus.</p>

More importantly, a Rubik&#039;s cube has 12+8+6=26 pieces. There are 12 edges of 2 stickers, 8 corners of 3 stickers, and 6 centers of 1 sticker. Note that edges and corners each have specific stickers in a particular order, and that a red-blue edge will always be a red-blue edge no matter how the cube is twisted. This might be more obvious when looking at a sticker-less cube such as this one. <img title="Dayan Zanchi Stickerless" alt="Dayan Zanchi Stickerless" src="http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v1/578250069_2/dayan-zhanchi-stickerless.jpg" width="306" height="307" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If one had all 26 pieces of the cube, how many different ways could it be put back together? </p>
<p>Even harder, how does that number decrease when the cube has to be put back into a solvable state? As a hint, note that seven corners may be oriented independently, but the 8th corner depends on the first 7. Similarly, 11 edges may be oriented independently, but the 12 depends on the first 11.  </p>
<p>Harder than that, how does that number change when the centers must be oriented correctly? While not obvious or important for a regular Rubik&#039;s cube, for arrow cubes or photo cubes the cube will not be solved until the centers face the correct direction. </p>

<p><em> <strong>JSS</strong>: This question is quite hard if you consider different cubes to be the same if they can be reoriented to look the same, or if they can be shuffled to look the same.

<p>NT:  5. Note that most sudoku puzzles have 180 degree rotational symmetry with regards to the locations that initially contain numbers (If the top left corner contains a starting number, so will with bottom right, and so on).  It was finally proven last Sunday that the minimum number of clues needed to solve a sudoku puzzle is 17 (that is, if a puzzle begins with 16 or fewer squares filled in, it is unsolvable.)  How many ways are there to select at least 17 squares in the grid such that the selection has 180 degree rotational symmetry?  How many ways are there to select at least 17 squares with this symmetry and then fill them?</p>

<p>-to start, how many different five card hands exists?</p>
<p>-knowing this what is the probability of being dealt a royal flush, the highest hand possible (A, K, Q, J, 10)?</p>
<p>Now that such a pipe dream is out of the way, we will assume that we are playing with yourself just for practice.</p>
<p>-What is the probability that you have been dealt a pair? (This is when two of your cards are the same value, and the other three are each different from the pair and each other?)</p>
<p>Now say for the sake of argument you have been dealt: {A?, 3?, 10?, 5?, 10?}, The strongest hands one could hope to make from this is a four of a kind, a full house, a flush, three of a kind, or two pair.</p>
<p>-Lets start with the flush. Since Ace is high card, find the probability of turning this hand into a flush of diamonds (all cards are of the suit diamonds) by discarding: 3?, 5?, 10?.  and drawing three replacements?</p>
<p>- So the odds of that aren&#039;t great. What is the probability that upon discarding the 3? and 5? that the two replacements will yield for of a kind? How about three of a kind? (remember that you can have either three 10s or three As) Now calculate the probability of a full house (This will be either A,A,10,10,10 or 10,10,A,A,A). Finally, whats the probability that you will get two pair (remember to discount getting two more 10s, because that makes four of a kind)? To find the probability that you will improve your hand by these means, add the probability of getting four of a kind, a full house, three of a kind, and two pair, what is this number?</p>
<p>- Repeat the previous question, but this time you should discard all but your pair of 10s. If you are looking at just the probability of improvement, which is the most logical choice, hope for a flush, swap 2 or swap 3?</p>

CLAIM: In any set of $h$ horses, all horses are the same color.

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Blue Eyes:</span><br /> <span style="font-size: xx-small;">The Hardest Logic Puzzle in the World</span>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.</p>
<p>On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.</p>
<p>The Guru is allowed to speak once (let&#039;s say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following:</p>
<p><strong>"I can see someone who has blue eyes."</strong></p>
<p>Who leaves the island, and on what night?</p>
<p>There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn&#039;t depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn&#039;t involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she&#039;s simply saying "I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn&#039;t me."</p>
<p>And lastly, the answer is not "no one leaves."</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Terry Tao discusses a much more vicious version: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">There is an island upon which a tribe resides. The tribe consists of 1000 people, with various eye colours. Yet, their religion forbids them to know their own eye color, or even to discuss the topic; thus, each resident can (and does) see the eye colors of all other residents, but has no way of discovering his or her own (there are no reflective surfaces). If a tribesperson does discover his or her own eye color, then their religion compels them to commit ritual suicide at noon the following day in the village square for all to witness. All the tribespeople are highly logical and devout, and they all know that each other is also highly logical and devout (and they all know that they all know that each other is highly logical and devout, and so forth).  ["Highly logical" means that any conclusion that can logically deduced from the information and observations available to an islander, will automatically be known to that islander.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Of the 1000 islanders, it turns out that 100 of them have blue eyes and 900 of them have brown eyes, although the islanders are not initially aware of these statistics (each of them can of course only see 999 of the 1000 tribespeople).</span></p>

<p>Lets write $aKb[/latex] iff <em>a</em> knows <em>b</em>, and [latex]a\not\!\! K b[/latex] iff <em>a</em> does not know <em>b.  </em>So [latex]c\in[1..n][/latex] is a celebrity iff [latex]\forall a\in[1..n],\; (a=c)\vee (aKc\wedge c\not\!\!Ka)$.  Can a group have more than one celebrity?</p>
<p>You are an outsider, sent by a news agency, to identify if there is a celebrity at a party of n people.  You want to ask people if they know specific other people, but don&#039;t want to annoy and get kicked out, so you want to ask few questions.   There are, of course, (<em>n</em>-1) possible questions per person, for a total of <em>n</em>(<em>n</em>-1).  How few questions do you need to ask to guarantee that you can always identify and confirm the identity of a celebrity, if one exists?  (You cannot ask one person "Do you know anyone here?&#039; without asking them n-1 questions, which is sure to get you kicked out.)</p>
<p>I suggest working the room in two phases: first, start by assuming<br /> that anyone could be a celebrity, and ask questions that try to rule<br /> people out.  Then, when you have single candidate, ask questions to<br /> confirm.</p>
<p>You should be able to use induction to obtain a strategy in which each person, with one possible exception, need be asked at most two questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No pressure, but your job depends on getting the right answer, so you<br /> must be correct, and want to ask the smallest number of questions possible...</p>]]></content><category>assn5 (24Oct)</category></question><question><title>Induction 31; Can you represent numbers as sets?</title><content><![CDATA[<p>An interesting recursive way to represent every non-negative integer $n[/latex] as a set [latex]S_n$ is the following:</p>

<p>The classic puzzle called the Towers of Hanoi consists of a board with three pegs and several disks of different diameters that fit over the pegs. In the starting position all the disks are in place on one peg, arranged in order of decreasing diameter from bottom to top. A move is made by lifting the top disk off a peg and placing it on another peg so that there is no smaller disk beneath it. The object of the puzzle is to transfer all the disks from one peg to another. Prove by induction that if the number of disks is <em>n</em>, the puzzle can be solved in $ 2^n - 1$ moves.</p>]]></content><category>assn5 (24Oct)</category></question><question><title>Induction 43: Prove this is a fair division of the cake?</title><content><![CDATA[<p>There are <em>n</em> people dividing a cake.  Each wants to get his or her &#039;fair share&#039; of 1/<em>n</em> th of the cake (and maybe a bit more).  But of course, some want more icing, some like the candies, some try to avoid the edge---each may have a different idea of what they would most like as their 1/<em>n</em> th of the cake.</p>
<p>So they agree do divide as follows: the oldest starts moving the knife slowly above the cake from one end.  If any younger one says, "Stop," then that end is cut off and given to the speaker.  The knife-wielder can also decide to stop and cut their own piece.  Prove by induction that each person goes away satisfied that they got 1/<em>n</em> of the cake.  </p>
